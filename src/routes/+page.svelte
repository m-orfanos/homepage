<article class="about">
  <h1>Hi, I'm Miltiadis!</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a software developer based in Eastern Canada. I have formal training in both
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_engineer">building engineering</a>
    and computer science. Most of my experience in the former is in project management, 
    specifically large civil engineering projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've been working professionally in the technology sector since 2012, and unprofessionally since
    2004 where I learned programming to solve engineering/math-related problems. You can find out
    more about my profesional career on
    <a href="https:// www.linkedin.com/in/morfanos">Linkedin</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my free time, I still find a joy in coding and learning new technologies, mostly through practical projects.
    However, I also believe it's important to be well-rounded, which is why I dedicate as much time, if not more,
    reading about various topics beyond tech. When I'm not learning something new, I like to go for runs, long walks, or
    play video games.
